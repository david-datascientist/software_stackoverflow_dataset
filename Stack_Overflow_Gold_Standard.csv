I am trying to understand where the google-api-java-client (and google-api-java-client-android) library sits with respect to GoogleApiClient in terms of accessing native google APIs. Details on the library here 1) If I want to access my own endpoints API, it would appear google-api-java-client is a better approach than GoogleAuthUtil (and clearly GoogleApiClient won't help there other than perhaps just picking an account and handling play services integration/update/missing/etc dialogs). 2) for native google APIs (eg Drive, Maps, Calendar, etc), which of the two would be the recommended approach?

My answer I'd write a class to which I can pass the look up values for each character, I'd then have a function that would iterate over the characters and encrypt the string. The lookup would be based on a binary tree to ensure that if the cypher would become more complex (say more than a single character at a time) the complexity would be O(n log(m)) where n is the length of the string to be encrypted and m the number of options in the encryption. The interviewer kept pushing for further optimizations and the best I could think of would be to tokenize the string to be translated say by word and extend lookup size to words, however I struggled to see a massive efficiency in this.

When I get to printing the output, the app doesn't crash, but nginx puts the error ""upstream prematurely closed FastCGI stdout while reading response header from upstream"" in the error file. I'm not really sure what's going on. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the output stream in FCGX_Request is a pointer. If I uncomment out the line it's able to print the response, but if I can't reinitialize the request to a new one each time, then I can't store them in the queue. What can I do to proberly store these FCGX_Requests in the queue for another thread to process? Thanks",negative
25420741,"I have written a code in java for web services of crm on demand. The code reads the 1st column (id) from excel and queries it in the crm and inserts the values accordingly. If the 'id' is found it inserts the other values, but when the 'id' is not found in the crm the code is terminated with error message. I want the code to query for a record and if found insert the other values, but if the record is not found it should skip that record and query for the next id without it being terminated in between. Please help... and also how to skip cells with no value(null)??",negative
